# Automated Environment Controller
A physical controller which keeps track of environmental data around itself. 
The data collected by the Data Logging Application is stored in a shared database, 
which then can be accessed by the Data Monitoring Application.

Configuration values for the sensors can be changes and controlled through the 
Data Management Application.
